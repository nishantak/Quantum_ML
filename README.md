# Quantum Machine Learning

Go through QuML.ipynb first for introduction.

### Quantum Computing
Uses quantum properties of quantum bits (qubits), and [consequent] quantum algorithms to process information better or faster than classical computer.

### Machine Learning
Statistics on steroids to get data derived patterns, predictions, or decisions.

## Quantum Machine Learning
Augment these machine learning techniques using quantum circuits/algorithms- either to enhance computation and optimization beyond classical scope or to represent data more effeciently

### what to know
- **Quantum Computing Foundations:**  Qubits, superposition, entanglement, unitary operations, measurement
- **Linear Algebra:** Hilbert spaces, tensor products, operators, eigenvalues
- **Classical ML Basics:** Supervised/unsupervised learning, optimization, loss functions
- **Relevant Quantum Algorithms:** Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC), Quantum SVMs, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Quantum PCA, Quantum FT

## Expressivity
Gauge how well our model works. Kind of interpreting what the model is doing with our data.
